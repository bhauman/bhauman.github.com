## Hey there!

I'm Bruce Hauman. I'm a Software Developer with over 12 years
experience in full stack web development. Currently, I'm having fun
making front end development more fluid, productive and fun for
ClojureScript developers.

On this page I've provided links to my open source work, conference
talks and other things that can give you a better idea of who I am and
what I do.

#### [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel)

Figwheel makes the holy grail of live editing and hot loading running
code a pragmatic reality for front end development. Figwheel currently sets
the standard for a fluid front end programming experience.

Figwheel has been popularly received by the ClojureScript community as evidenced in the [State of Clojure 2015 Survey](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2016/1/28/state-of-clojure-2015-survey-results) and the outpouring of [thanks](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=figwheel%20thanks&src=typd) and [appreciation](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=figwheel%20awesome&src=typd).

#### [Devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel)

Devcards takes live programming even further by providing an
environment to work on front-end components apart from the application
and exercise them in many states.

Devcards is a new innovative tool and proposes a new way to think about
the process of front end programming.

## Dome design and living

I have designed a unique way to quickly construct affordable domes
from easily obtainable materials.
