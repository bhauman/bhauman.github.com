## Hey there!

I'm Bruce Hauman. I'm a Software Developer with over 20 years
experience in full stack web development. I enjoy making programming
more fluid, productive and fun for ClojureScript developers.

On this page I've provided links to some of my open-source work,
conference talks and other things that can give you a better idea of
who I am and what I do.

## Endorsements

> For well over a decade, Bruce Haumun has been an important contributor
> and tooling visionary in the Clojure/ClojureScript community. Bruce's
> Figwheel still represents a benchmark against which so many
> "hot-reloading" tools fall short, and DevCards long foreshadowed
> the power of the UI testing approach embraced by Storybook.js. Bruce has
> that uncommon combination of compiler know-how, a profound respect for
> users, and the belief that tooling could be so much better without
> wandering off into the research weeds. Bruce is that truly rarest of
> rare birds, a force multiplier for the people around him. He has my
> highest recommendation.

## Advent of Code 2024 Answers

I definitely enjoy the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.

Here are my answers to 2024 edition. [https://github.com/bhauman/adv2024/tree/main/src/adv2024](https://github.com/bhauman/adv2024/tree/main/src/adv2024)

## Open Source Authorship

#### [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main)

Figwheel broke new ground making the holy grail of live editing and
hot loading running code a pragmatic reality for front end
development. Several features, like heads-up displays announcing
compiler errors, that many JavaScript developers experience everyday
started here.

Figwheel has been popularly received by the ClojureScript community as evidenced in the [State of Clojure 2015 Survey](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2016/1/28/state-of-clojure-2015-survey-results) and the outpouring of [thanks](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=figwheel%20thanks&src=typd) and [appreciation](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=figwheel%20awesome&src=typd).

#### [Devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel)

Devcards takes live programming even further by providing an
environment to work on front-end components apart from the application
and exercise them in many states.

Devcards is a innovative tool and proposes a new way to think about
the process of front end programming.
