# Canada COVID-19 by Province

These charts track the progress of COVID-19 in Canada by Province.

The data is sourced from the [Johns Hopkins University Center for
Systems Science and
Engineering](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

These should be updated daily.

The charts were inspired by the excellent charts made from the
[Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest). To see
Candas relationship to other countries that is a good place to start.
