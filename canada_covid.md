# Canada COVID-19 by Province

These charts track the progress of COVID-19 in Canada by province and should be updated daily at 8pm EST.

The data is sourced from the [Johns Hopkins University Center for
Systems Science and
Engineering](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

These charts are inspired by the excellent COVID-19 charts created by the
[Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest). To see
Canada's relationship to other countries that is a good place to start.
