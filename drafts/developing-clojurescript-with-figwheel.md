## Developing ClojureScript Live with Figwheel - ClojureWest Talk"

I recently had a lot of fun giving a talk about [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) at
ClojureWest 2015. Figwheel facilitates an almost effortless live
development workflow when you are working with ClojureScript and
React.js.

In the talk I explain why I created Figwheel and I demonstrate
its current feature set live.
