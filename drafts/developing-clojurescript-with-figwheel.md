## Developing ClojureScript Live with Figwheel - ClojureWest Talk

I recently had a lot of fun giving a talk about [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) in Portland, at
ClojureWest 2015. Figwheel facilitates an almost effortless live
development workflow when you are working with ClojureScript.

In the talk I explain why I created Figwheel and then I demonstrate
its current feature set live.

The Demo starts at about (11:10)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-kj2qwJa_E&feature=youtu.be&t=669].

The question and answer section starts at (31:50)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-kj2qwJa_E&feature=youtu.be&t=1910].

ClojureWest was an absolutely amazing experience. I enjoyed meeting some absolutely great folks and I am really looking forward to next year.
