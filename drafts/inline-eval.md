Inline evaluation has been around for a long time, but not every
programmer has had the chance to use it. If you haven't, this is an
opportunity to try it out.

To this end I've coded up a simple editor with some examples so you
can experience how it works.

We will use `Control-r` to *RUN/EVALUATE* bits of code from inside the
editor panes below.
 
To see it in action, place your cursor immediately after the
expression you want to evaluate in the editor below. Then, press
`Control-r`âˆ’hold the `Control` key down while pressing the `r` key.

For example, if you want to evaluate `(+ 1 2 3)`, position the cursor
after the closing parenthesis `)` before pressing `Control-r`. 

_We will be using `^r` as shorthand for `Control-r` from now on._

<div class="cljs-editor-new"><pre>1
;`-- Place cursor after 1 then hit ^r

"Gremlins are cuties!"
;                     `-- Place cursor after " then hit ^r

(+ 1 2 3)
;   `-- Place cursor after 1 then hit ^r

(+ 1 2 3)
;        `-- Place cursor after the ')' then hit ^r

(+ 1 (/ 8 2) (* 2 3) )
;           `-------`-` Place cursor after each ')' and then hit ^r

(+ 1
   (/ 8 2)
   (* 2 3))
;          `-- Place cursor after ')' and then hit ^r

 
;`-- Place cursor above this line and hit ^r
</pre></div>

When you pressed `^r`, the editor found the closest preceding complete
expression and sent it it to a runtime session (REPL) for
evaluation. The result then appeared right next to your code, exactly
where you were already looking. No context change needed to see the
code run.

You may have also noticed that you can evaluate smaller parts of an
expression, like `(/ 8 2)`, just as easily as a full expression. You
can also evaluate expressions that span multiple lines as well.

I don't know about you, but I frequently forget function names, and
sometimes, instead of searching for them, I simply try evaluating them
inline to see if they exist and if they behave the way I expect them
to.

For example, I know I created a function that renders HTML into a
`div` above the editor, but I can't remember if it's called
`show-html` or `display-html`. Let's evaluate both of the expressions
below to see which one works:

<div class="cljs-editor-new"><pre>
;; was it show-html or display-html??
(show-html "&lt;h1&gt;Testing!&lt;/h1&gt;")
;;                             `-- ^r eval here

(display-html "&lt;h1&gt;Testing!&lt;/h1&gt;")
;;                                `-- ^r eval here
</pre></div>

With inline evaluation, I can quickly discover which function is
defined **and** if does what I expect it to. This allows me to not
leave the editor and continue coding without breaking my flow.

Let's directly experience what the `look` and `move` functions below do.

_From here onward, you can assume that each expression in the all of
the examples below is intended to be evaluated with `^r`._

<div class="cljs-editor-new"><pre>
(look)

(move :east)




</pre></div>

We can see that the `look` function is returning data that is meant to
describe where one is on their journey through a text adventure and
that the `move` function can move you through that world.

Evaling these functions in the editor could work as a spartan
interface to the game, but it would definitely be better to display
this data using our `display-html` function. Right?

Let's work on formatting the data returned by `look` with HTML.

<div class="cljs-editor-new"><pre>
;; First lets see what data is returned
(look)

;; I see a :desc key that holds a description 
(get (look) :desc)

;; OK we have a description let's put that into an HTML string
(str "&lt;p&gt;" (get (look) :desc) "&lt;/p&gt;")

;; Now let's display that HTML
(display-html (str "&lt;p&gt;" (get (look) :desc) "&lt;/p&gt;"))
</pre></div>

Actually, let' break out that paragraph tag into it's own function:

<div class="cljs-editor-new" data-sci-ctx="main-game"><pre>
;; Evalute this to define the paragraph function
(defn p [content] 
  (str "&lt;p&gt;" content "&lt;/p&gt;"))

;; now let's see how it works
(p "Hello")

(display-html (p (get (look) :desc)))
</pre></div>

OK, now we are getting somewhere. But we also have to format the
things that are `:seen` in the room:

<div class="cljs-editor-new" data-sci-ctx="main-game"><pre>
(look)

;; The seen key holds a description of what you see:
(get (look) :seen)

;; let's format it a little
(str "You see: " (get (look) :seen))

;; put it in a paragraph
(p (str "You see: " (get (look) :seen)))

;; let's add the :desc and the :seen together
(str
  (p (get (look) :desc))
  (p (str "You see: " (get (look) :seen))))
 
;; then display it
(display-html
  (str
    (p (get (look) :desc))
    (p (str "You see: " (get (look) :seen)))))
		
</pre></div>

So we're building up some code to format the the data returned from the
`look` function as HTML.

So let's put this code in a function and start working on the function
instead of just composing expressions.

<div class="cljs-editor-new" data-sci-ctx="main-game"><pre>
;; so here's our initial format function
(defn look-html [data]
  (str
    (p (get data :desc))
    (p (str "You see: " (get data :seen)))))

;; let's see if it's working
(look-html (look))

;; and finally
(display-html (look-html (look)))

</pre></div>

OK now we have a `look-html` function which we can re-use, but there
is definitely room for improvement.  If we look at the data that's
returned by the `look` function you can see that there is also an
`:img-path`. Let's use that to add more visual interest to our game
display.

<div class="cljs-editor-new" data-sci-ctx="main-game"><pre>
;; let's build up an expression to format the :image-path as 
;; an img tag
(get (look) :img-path)
(str "&lt;img src='" (get (look) :img-path) "'/&gt;")

;; let's insert the image tag into our look-html function
(defn look-html [data]
  (str
    ;; v-- added img here --v
    (str "&lt;img src='" (get (look) :img-path) "'/&gt;") 
    (p (get data :desc))
    (p (str "You see: " (get data :seen)))))

;; let's see if it's working
(look-html (look))

;; and let's take a look!
(display-html (look-html (look)))

</pre></div>

Not bad at all. OK, now we only have one more piece of information
left to add to our `look-html` function. When you evaluate the
`(look)` function you will notice an `:exits` entry which gives the
player clues about which directions they can move from their current
location.

I think we are at the point where you can add the `:exits` info to the
`look-html` function.

<div class="cljs-editor-new" data-sci-ctx="main-game"><pre>
;; here's the :exits data
(get (look) :exits)

;; Add the exits data to the function below:
(defn look-html [data]
  (str
    (str "&lt;img src='" (get (look) :img-path) "'/&gt;")
    (p (get data :desc))
    (p (str "You see: " (get data :seen)))
    (p (str "Exits: "    ))))

;; test it out here to see if it's working
(look-html (look))

;; and finally take a look!
(display-html (look-html (look)))

</pre></div>

### Do you want to play a game?

Alright we've built our `look-html` function now let's play a game.

You can now explore the text adventure using the functions below.
There are a bunch of new functions that let you interact with the
game. Luckily, you can simply evaluate them to discover what they do.

<div class="cljs-editor-new" data-sci-ctx="main-game"><pre>

(display-html (look-html (look)))
(move :east)

(stack)
(push :picture)
(peek)
(pop)

;; eventually??
(unlock-function :_something?_)

;; start over?
(reset)
</pre></div>

Don't forget that you can change the UI above. 

Some UI tweaks you can do:
* create a `looki` function that calls `(display-html (look-html (look)))` 
* a new `movi` function that calls `move` and then `looki`
* add the stack to `look-html`

### And end or maybe a beginning

Thanks for taking the time to experience inline evaluation.

The goal of this post was to demonstrate the instant feedback that
inline evaluation provides. This powerful development feature keeps
you present in the problem you're trying to solve, maintaining your
flow and concentration where it matters most - in your code.

While these examples are simplified inside a toy editor, this
experience is very real. Clojure programmers (and others who use
similar evaluation capabilities) apply this technique daily in
professional settings across diverse domains - from data pipelines
powering major retail chains to video streaming services you likely
use yourself.

My argument isn't that Clojure is superior to other languages, but
rather that inline evaluation is an incredibly valuable feature that
deserves wider adoption across programming environments. It raises an
interesting question: why hasn't this powerful technique become
ubiquitous in modern programming?

Perhaps by experiencing it firsthand, you'll be inspired to seek out
or build tools that provide this kind of immediate feedback in your
own development work.
