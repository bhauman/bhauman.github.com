# Core.Logic and Eight Queens

I have been reading The Reasoned Schemer and playing with core.logic
recently. I saw the very interesting post on solving the problem in
assembly on HN and that was all the prompting I needed to give it a go
in core.logic.

Core.logic runs in ClojureScript so we can write incredibly expressive
relational programs that run in the browser.

Below is an interactive 8 queens solver that is written in core.logic.
