## What is it?

It's a frameless geodesic dome designed to be easy to fabricate and build.  

It is 18 feet wide at the widest point and about 13 feet tall. It
feels very spacious for it's 209 square foot floor.

The dome is built out of 3/16" corrugated plastic and 3/4" blueboard
foam insulation. The shell of the dome is a basically a foam board
insulation sandwich. There is an outer plastic dome, two layers of
tightly fitted blueboard insulation and then an inner plastic dome.
It's all held together with bolts that bolt through all the layers.
The shell of the dome is about 2 1/2 inches thick.

There is no frame in this dome. The shell is self supporting much like
and igloo is self supporting.

The dome has a floor system held up by cinder blocks. The floor is
also insulated with 2 layers of blueboard foam insulation.

It has electricity and is heated with a single electric radiator and
cooled with an exhaust fan and small window sized air conditioner.

The materials are all easily attainable and it cost about $2100 to
build it at the time. 

The dome shell is also extremely easy to disassemble making it
a portable structure.

## Advocacy

I have a fairly lengthy relationship with designing, building and
living in alternative structures at this point. This dome is the
culmination of that experience.  3 and a half years after building it
I am ready to advocate it as an excellent alternative lightweight
structure.  I think this frameless dome balances many of the
trade-offs of lightweight structures and arrives at an optimal
structure that drastically minimizes construction complexity, time and
price while maximizing livability.

This dome provides the cost and fabrication savings that a more tent
like structure (teepee, yurt, canvas dome) would provide.  Unlike
these the tent like structures this dome is entirely waterproof and
insulated. The ability to regulate the interior environment easily
makes all the difference when it comes to living in one of these
structures.

Fabricating this dome is easier than many of the other alternative
structures. The materials are easily accessible.  The corrugated
plastic would probably need to be ordered in
[bulk](http://corrugatedplastics.net/5mmCorrugatedPlasticSheets.html)
and drop shipped but the simplifying properties of the material
entirely justify it.  Everything else is simply sourced through your
local hardware provider. There are no special hardware parts that need
to be fabricated or sourced. Only standard carpentry tools are need to
fabricate the dome. In fact a box cutter and a drill is all that is
needed for the shell of the dome.

This dome also provides a tremendously fast construction time which is
comparable or faster than other lightweight structures. When you
consider that you are getting a tight dry insulated structure the
construction time is actually remarkable. Once the floor system is in
place and the shell pieces are fabricated the structure can be built
in a day or two by a couple people moving at a human pace.

The fast construction time is mirrored by an equally fast disassembly
time. Making the structure portable. A couple of pickup truck loads of
material and you are off to a new spot. Of course portability of the
entire structure will be highly impacted by the design decisions that
reach beyond the shell of the structure.

There is mental overhead caused by the dome geometry. However,
studying a soccer ball and understanding the relationship between the
white octagons and black pentagons is the only understanding is
required of a lay person. I'll try to demonstrate later how the
construction of this dome drastically simplifies the inherent
complexity of a geodesic dome.

The living space of the dome feels open, clean, spacious and novel.
There is a sense that you are not compromising comfort but rather
living in a space that is actually nicer than many conventional living
quarters.  I can't really emphasize this enough: the dome is an
absolute pleasure to live in.

The total energy input of the structure is a fraction of what is used
in conventional construction while providing a very nice living area.

## Solar gain

Solar gain can potentially be a problem in the dome during the summer.
Most small lightweight structures suffer from this problem. 

My dome is nestled in a group of deciduous trees which shade 60% of
the dome in the summer. There is also a conventional home exhaust fan
mounted on top of the dome. So between the shade, the insulation and
the exhaust fan it is possible to maintain the temperature of the dome
close to the shade temperature outside. If it is still too warm inside
a small air conditioner can adequately cool the interior.

While solar gain is a problem in the summer it is welcome in the winter
and can provide quite a bit of needed heating.

## Plastic breakdown

The polypropylene in the corrugated plastic is expected to break down
in UV solar radiation after a period of a few years.  3 and a half
years later this hasn't been a noticable problem.  Right now I am expecting
that I will only need to replace a few of the exterior sheets which are
receiving the bulk of solar exposure. The cost of 4 or 5 sheets of
material every few years is comparable to cost of paint. The effort
required to replace the sheets is minimal as well.

## Hacking housing

The housing problem is an inspiring challenge. The current housing
system requires that we use a tremendous amount of energy to construct
and maintain a home.  The comfort and living convenience that we get
from these large and inefficient houses does not increase linearly
with their higher cost.  There is a decreasing [marginal
efficiency](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/364716/marginal-efficiency-of-investment)
as investment in a home goes up. This extra cost often translates into
a lifetime of working (often working on something you don't care
about) in order to service rent or a mortgage debt.

As the reality of our modern economic situation continues to decimate
all faith in the American dream, it would be nice to literally think
outside of the box and finally listen to the call of [Buckminster
Fuller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller) exhorting us
to use our intelligence and modern materials to transcend the idea
that housing is a scarce resource.

The growing [tiny housing
movement](http://www.thetinylife.com/what-is-the-tiny-house-movement/)
is evidence that a lifestyle unburdened by exhorbent housing costs is
becoming an attractive option for many people.

## Tackling geodesic complexity

Here is a model of the basic geodesic geometry of the dome:

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/basic_dome_geometry.png"/>
</p>

The geodesic dome minimizes the amount of materials needed to enclose a
given amount of space. It doesn't necessarily minimize construction
time or material/part complexity.

I am going to use the number of parts required to build a dome as a
way to quantify how complex it is to build a dome. The part count of a
project is a good proxy for how much raw work you are going to be
putting into it.  You have to fabricate and assemble all those parts
and that takes time, money and energy.

The frame of a dome has a pretty high part count.  In the simple
18ft diameter dome above there are 207 struts and 81 hubs where the
struts meet. That's at least 288 parts for the frame only.  Let's say
we cut triangles for the outer skin, we'll need 135 triangles just for
the outside skin. Add insulation for each of the triangles and you get
another 135 parts. So including insulation and an inside skin that is
a total of 693 parts!  

With a very conservative estimate of 6 minutes per part of total
handling time. That's almost 9 8 hour working days just for the outer
shell of a dome.  That doesn't include a floor system for it to sit
on. For an 209 square foot structure this is a lot of handling
compared to conventional construction methods.

This complexity kept me away from domes.  The sheer amount of work
required to just experiment with them was daunting.

My perception of domes changed when I saw Steve Miller's
[plydome](http://andrewdurham.com/formactive/cottage_1.htm).

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/stevemiller_plydome.jpg" style="width:170px"/>
</p>

The idea is based on Buckminster Fuller's [Self-strutted
geodesic plydome](http://www.google.com/patents/US2905113) patent.

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/self_strut_patent.png" />
</p>

The plydome is a considerable departure from normal geodesic
construction methods. There is no frame. The skin is the frame! No
complex hubs and strutting needed. No need to fabricate a gazzilion
triangles and struts.

The amazing idea behind the plydome is that by using the built in
strength of the sheeting material under flex tension we get a frame
and an enclosing envelope in one material.  This drastically
simplifies the fabrication and building of a dome. It reduces the part
count by a very large factor.  One sheet of plywood replaces 7 struts,
a couple of hubs and two plywood triangles and a lot of joining
hardware.  You are dividing the total parts needed by a factor of 7.
That is a remarkable improvement.  So if you needed 700 parts before,
you now only need 100.

## Frameless Synergy

In conventional stick frame construction the insulation and
weatherproof siding make absolutely zero contribution to the holding
the structure itself up. Even the external sheathing is only used as a
lateral brace for the 2x4 walls. It's pretty wasteful.

In the frameless dome the skin and the insulation serve more purposes
than just waterproofing and insulation.  The plastic skin serves as a
weather proof skin and provides structural tension to the layer
below. The insulation insulates and provides the bulk of the
structural support. The inner skin provides structural support and
clean walls to the interior of the structure.

All the materials work together in a beautiful harmonious
efficiency. This boils down to more space for a lot less material.

## The construction of current dome

What follows is not a complete guide to how to build the dome but
rather a general outline of how I broke down the geodesic geometry
into a few easily assembled parts.  The idea being that this
methodology can be reused for other geodesic structures.

There is enough here for experienced makers to have a go but if you
are intent on making one of these domes
[contact](mailto:bhauman@gmail.com) me.

## Geodesic Geometry

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/basic_dome_geometry.png"/>
</p>

Geodesic domes initially look complex but there is simplicity here.
Geodesic domes are normally based on and underlying
[icosahedron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedron).  You can
trace the icosahedron in the structure above if you connect the
vertices in middle of the purple pentagons to each other.

This is a basic 3v geodesic dome. What I am trying to do is reduce the
part count and make it easier to build.

I am going to map a set of triangles to a single sheet of 4x8 sheeting
material. I want to do this in a way that creates as few items to cut
as possible. In order to do this I am going to pick a repeating pattern.

If we look at the structure we can see some obvious repeating
patterns.  In fact two shapes jump right out at us. The entire
structure is made up of hexagons and pentagons. You can see them in
the illustration below. The pentagons are purple and an example
octagon is outlined in blue.

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/hexagon_highlight.png" style="width:
80%"/>
</p>

For soccer fans this pattern of octagons and pentagons should look
familiar. You are essentially looking at a [soccer ball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Soccer_ball.svg).

Now let's pick out a repeating pattern of triangles that maps to a 4x8
sheet with as little waste as possible.

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/half_hexagon_shape.png"/>
</p>

This shape is half of one of the octagons found in the structure.
This one shape repeated 30 times accounts for 73% of the skin of this
structure. When you consider that we are going to have two plastic
domes(interior and exterior) and 2 foam board domes for insulation.
The discovery of one shape that covers so much area is a very
effective simplification.

If we lay out this shape so that it fits on a 4x8 sheet of material
this is what we get:

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/first_peice_layout.png"/>
</p>

In the diagram above we have laid out the selected triangles from the dome
model. In addition we have added outer lines that bound the
triangles. These outer lines lay 2 inches from the edges outer edges
of the triangles.

If you refer back to the photos at the start of this post you can see
that the plastic sheets do not butt up edge to edge but that they
overlap each other. In order to shed rain, the plastic sheets overlap
each other as shingles on a roof would.

Thats why there are outer lines in the diagram above.  They account
for the overlap that is needed to provide for the shingling overlap
and to provide surface at the vertices to allow bolting through them.

For the outer corrugated plastic skin we will layout out this pattern
on a corrugated plastic sheet and drill holes where the vertices of
the triangles are and then cut on the outer lines to obtain our final
skin piece.

When we lay out these sheets we are going to be very precise about
where we drill the holes because that determines how well the
structure fits together. If they are off, there is a good chance that
the structure will not fit together at all. The outer lines that
create the overlap are much less important. 

You can cut blue board insulation using this same pattern but we are
not going to use the outer edge of the pattern as a cutting line.  We
are going to use the outer edges of the triangles. The insulation does
not overlap but rather butts up edge to edge.

The single pattern above can produce most of the outer skin and blue
board foam insulation. The pattern above can be used to produce all
the hexagons in the structure.  Now we are going to address the
pentagons.  The pentagons are going to be divided into the two patterns
below.

### Layouts for the pentagons

We essentially repeat the process above for the pentagons in the
structure.  We are going to map the pentagon to layouts that will fit
onto 4x8 material.

Let's divide the pentagon into two parts and lay them out. We'll
start with this diamond shape:

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/pentagon_two_peice.png"/>
</p>

We can fit two of these diamond shapes into one 4x8 sheet as shown below:

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/pentagon_two_piece_layout.png"/>
</p>

Next we have the lower part of the pentagon:

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/pentagon_three_piece.png"/>
</p>

Which gets laid out on a 4x8 sheet like this:

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/pentagon_lower_layout.png"/>
</p>

Well here we are we three different layouts that we can use to produce
most of the shell of the dome. 

## Three shapes!! 164 parts!!

The three shapes we derived above amount to a remarkable
simplification in fabrication and construction.  We have decimated the
complexity of the dome.

This approach makes this dome among the most simple to build that I
have witnessed. The part count for the whole shell (inner insulation,
and outer) comes to 164 parts! The hubs are completely eliminated and
replaced with simple bolts. The bolts account for all the necessary
fastening needed to hold the shell together.

The parts of the dome are also extremely lightweight. You will need
ladders or scaffolding but there is absolutely no heavy lifting
involved.

There is the strain of knowing which parts go where.  But you
literally can use a soccer ball as your model.  Seriously you can have
one on hand to know weather you are currently making an octagon or a
pentagon.

## More parts

There are some other shapes. If you refer back to the dome diagram you
will notice that the bottom row of triangles is truncated to sit on a flat
surface. These are derived from the previous layouts and are simply
truncated versions of two of the previous layouts.

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/bottom_pieces.png"/>
</p>

The inner plastic dome has the same three shapes but they are just
slightly smaller than the original three patterns.

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/inner_dome_patterns.png"/>
</p>

Well that is all the patterns needed for the shell of the dome. Keep
in mind I didn't do any crazy math to calculate these lengths.  I used
[Google Sketch Up](http://www.sketchup.com/).  I imported a 3v
geodesic model and then scaled it to the right size. I then took the
measurements right from the model.  No rocket science here just
gratitude for the availability of fantastic easy to use tools.

## Other details

Of course I have just given a guide to the shell.  I have said nothing
of doors, windows, ventilation, lighting etc. If there is enough
interest I may do some follow up posts describing how I tackled these
different challenges.  But the materials are very easy to work with
and thus amenable to all sorts of windows and doors.


## Living in the dome

I think its very important to live in a structure before you advocate
it.  I have to say that I am very pleased with dome life so far.  The
insulation works really well for the size and shape of the structure.
I never get exceptionally cold or warm.  Tree cover has been an
essential ingredient in this.  The leaves come out in the summer to
shield the dome from too much solar gain and they go away in the
winter allowing solar gain to appreciably heat the dome.

The dome has survived it's first 3 and a half years.  The exterior
corrugated plastic was supposed to show degredation from solar
exposure by now. I fully expected that I would have to replace some of
the exterior corrugated plastic. But to my surprise the plastic still
going strong. I suspect that I will only have to replace a few of the
pieces that get the most sun.  I liken plastic replacement to the
process of touching up the paint job on a house.


## Early attempts

I have iterated on this idea a bit. The first one was made out sheets
of plywood and had many of the characteristic properties of a Bucky
plydome.

<img src="/assets/images/plydome_first.jpg"/>

This dome worked but it had the following problems:

* a lot bolts are needed to hold it together
* the openings are all oddly shaped and hard to cover
* the wood sheeting doesn't like rain

<img src="/assets/images/plastic_dome_first.jpg"/>

This second attempted to fix the problems of the first. The only
great improvement was the plastic.  I was still stuck on the idea of
using rectilinear material.

<img src="/assets/images/plastic_dome_second.jpg"/>

This final design lets go of the idea of rectilinear sheeting material
and only uses one bolt at each vertex.  This design traded strength
for lower part count and ease of assembly.
