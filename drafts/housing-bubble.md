## What is it?

It's a frameless geodesic dome designed to be easy to fabricate and build.  

It is 18 feet wide at the widest point and about 13 feet tall. It
feels very spacious for it's 209 square foot floor.

The dome is built out of corrugated plastic and blueboard foam
insulation. The shell of the dome is a basically a foam board
insulation sandwich. There is an outer plastic dome, two layers of
tightly fitted blue board insulation and then an inner plastic dome.
It's all held together with bolts that bolt through all the layers.
The shell of the dome is about 2 1/2 inches thick.

There is no frame in this dome. The shell is self supporting much like
and igloo is self supporting.

The dome has a floor system held up by cinder blocks. The floor is
also insulated with 2 layers of blue board foam insulation.

It has electricity and is heated with a single electric radiator and
cooled with a small window sized air conditioner.

The materials are all easily attainable and it cost about $2100 to
build it.

The dome is also extremely easy to disassemble and is theoretically
portable although I haven't done that yet.

## Hacking housing

Why do this?  To me it's an inspiring problem. There is a real need
for housing that is insulated, clean, dry, attractive, interesting,
affordable and easy to build.  There is a inverse correlation between
the cost of our housing and our freedom.

The current housing system requires a tremendous amount of energy
input to construct and maintain.  The comfort and living convenience
that we get from these large and inefficient houses does not increase
linearly with their higher cost.  There is a decreasing [marginal
efficiency](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/364716/marginal-efficiency-of-investment)
as investment in a home goes up. This extra cost often translates into
a lifetime of working (often working on something you don't care
about) to pay rent or a mortgage.

As people find it increasingly difficult to either find fullfilling
work or just work it would be nice to literally think outside of the
box and finally listen to the call of Buckminster Fuller exhorting us
to use our intelligence and modern materials/engineering to transcend
the idea that housing is a scarce resource.

Housing still costs money but it can cost tremendously less and be
tremendously simpler to maintain.

The [tiny housing
movement](http://www.thetinylife.com/what-is-the-tiny-house-movement/)
is here for reason and as far as I can tell current economic realities
are going to ensure that it is here to stay.

## Tackling geodesic complexity

Here is a model of the basic geodesic geometry of the dome:

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/basic_dome_geometry.png"/>
</p>

The geodesic dome minimizes the amount materials needed to enclose a
given amount of space. It doesn't necessarily minimize construction
time or material/part complexity.

There is complexity in the structure of a dome. The part count of a
project is a good proxy for how much raw work you are going to be
putting into it.  You have to fabricate and assemble all those parts
and that takes time, money and energy. We'll use part count to
quantify that complexity.

A the frame of a dome has a pretty high part count.  In the simple
18ft diameter dome above there are 207 struts and 81 hubs where the
struts meet. That's at least 288 parts for the frame only.  Let's say
we cut triangles for the outer skin, we'll need 135 triangles just for
the outside skin. Add insulation for each of the triangles and you get
another 135 parts. So with an inside and outside skin thats a total of
693 parts!  

So with a very conservative estimate of 6 minutes per part of total
handling time. That's almost 9 8 hour working days just for the
outershell.  That doesn't include a floor system for it to sit on. For
an 209 square foot foot structure this is a lot of handling compared
to conventional construction methods.

This complexity kept me away from domes for a while.  The sheer amount
of work required to just experiment with them was daunting.

My perception of domes changed when I saw the
[plydome](http://andrewdurham.com/formactive/cottage_1.htm).

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/stevemiller_plydome.jpg" style="width:170px"/>
</p>

The idea is based on Buckminster Fuller's [Self-strutted
geodesic plydome](http://www.google.com/patents/US2905113) patent.

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/self_strut_patent.png" />
</p>

The idea is really different than what we normally think of when we
see geodesic domes.  There is no frame.  The skin is the frame! No
complex hubs and strutting needed. No need to fabricate a gazzilion
triangles and struts.

The amazing idea behind the plydome is that by using the built in
strength of sheeting material under flex tension we get a frame and an
enclosing envelope in one material.  This drastically simplifies the
fabrication and building of a dome. It reduces the part count by a
very large factor.  One sheet of plywood replaces 7 struts, a couple
of hubs and two plywood triangles and a lot of joining hardware.  You
are dividing the total parts needed by a factor of 10 at least.  That
is a non trivial improvement.  So if you needed 1000 parts before, you
now only need 100. 

## Frameless Synergy

In conventional stick frame construction the insulation and
weatherproof siding make absolutely zero contribution to the holding
the structure itself up. Even the external sheathing is only used as a
lateral brace for the 2x4 walls. It's pretty wasteful.

In the frameless dome the skin and the insulation serve more purposes
than just waterproofing and insulation.  The plastic skin serves as a
weather proof skin and provides structural tension to the layer
below. The insulation insulates and provides the bulk of the
structural support. The inner skin provides structural support and
clean walls to the interior of the structure.

All the materials work together in a beautiful harmonious
efficiency. This boils down to more space for a lot less material.

## The construction of current dome

## Geodesic Geometry

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/basic_dome_geometry.png"/>
</p>

Geodesic domes are normally based on and underlying
[icosahedron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedron).  You can trace
the icosahedron in the structure above if you connect the vertices in
middle of the purple pentagons to each other.  

This is a basic 3v geodesic dome. What I am trying to do is reduce the
part count and make it easier to build.

I am going to map a set of triangles to a single sheet of 4x8 sheeting
material. I want to do this in a way that creates as few items to cut
as possible. In order to do this I am going to pick a repeating pattern.

If we look at the structure we can see some obvious repeating
patterns.  In fact two shapes jump right out at us. The entire
structure is made up of hexagons and pentagons. You can see them in
the illustration below. The pentagons are purple and an example
octagon is outlined in blue.

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/hexagon_highlight.png" style="width:
80%"/>
</p>

Now let's pick out a shape that maps to a 4x8 sheet with as little
waste as possible. 

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/half_hexagon_shape.png"/>
</p>

This one shape repeated 30 times accounts for 73% of the skin of this
structure. When you consider that we are going to have two plastic
domes(interior and exterior) and 2 foam board domes for insulation.
The discovery of one shape that covers so much area is a pretty
amazing simplifier.

If we lay this shape out on a 4x8 sheet of material this is what we
get:

<p>
<img src="/assets/images/dome/first_peice_layout.png"/>
</p>

In the diagram above we have laid out the selected triangles from the dome
model. In addition we have added outer lines that bound the
triangles. These outer lines lay 2 inches from the edges outer edges
of the triangles.

If you refer back to the photos at the start of this post you can see
that the plastic sheets do not but up edge to edge but that they
overlap each other. In order to shed rain, the plastic sheets overlap
each other as shingles on a roof would.

Thats why there are outer lines in the diagram above.  They account
for the overlap that is needed to provide for the shingling overlap
and to provide surface at the vertices to allow bolting through them.

For the outer corrugated plastic skin we will layout out this pattern
on a corrugated plastic sheet and drill holes where the vertices of
the triangles are and then cut on the outer lines to obtain our final
skin piece.

When we lay out these sheets we are going to be very precise about
where we drill the holes because that determines how well the
structure fits together. If they are off there is a good chance that
the structure will not fit together at all. The outer lines that
create the overlap are much less important. 

You can cut blue board insulation using this same pattern but we are
not going to use the outer edge as a cutting line.  We are going to
use the outer edges of the triangles. The insulation does not overlap
but rather butts up edge to edge. 

The single pattern above can produce most of the outer skin and
blueboard foam insulation. The pattern above captures all the hexogons
in the structure.  Now we are going to address the pentagons.  The
pentagons are going to be dived into the two patterns below.

### Pieces for the pentagons

So let's divide the pentagon into two parts and lay them out. We'll
start with this one:

<img src="/assets/images/dome/pentagon_two_peice.png"/>

We can fit two of these shapes into one 4x8 sheet as shown below:

<img src="/assets/images/dome/pentagon_two_piece_layout.png"/>

Next we have the lower part of the pentagon:

<img src="/assets/images/dome/pentagon_three_piece.png"/>

Which gets laid out on a 4x8 sheet like this:

<img src="/assets/images/dome/pentagon_lower_layout.png"/>


## Early attempts

I have iterated on this idea a bit. The first one was made out sheets
of plywood and had many of the characteristic properties of a Bucky
plydome.

<img src="/assets/images/plydome_first.jpg"/>

This dome worked but it had the following problems:

* a lot bolts are needed to hold it together
* the openings are all oddly shaped and hard to cover
* the wood sheeting doesn't like rain

<img src="/assets/images/plastic_dome_first.jpg"/>

This second attempted to fix the problems of the first. The only
great improvement was the plastic.  I was still stuck on the idea of
using rectilinear material.

<img src="/assets/images/plastic_dome_second.jpg"/>

This final design lets go of the idea of rectilinear sheeting material
and only uses one bolt at each vertex.  This design traded strength
for lower part count and ease of assembly.
