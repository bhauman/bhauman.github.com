If you are using ido completion in emacs you can delete a file easily! <p /> When ido is completing a file you can just type Ctrl-k and ido will <br />ask you if you want to delete it. Nice! <p /> What is ido? <br /><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings</a>
