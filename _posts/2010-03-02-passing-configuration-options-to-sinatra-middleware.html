title: Passing configuration options to Sinatra Middleware

When you are using Sinatra::Base apps as middleware it's sometimes <br />necessary to pass in configuration options. <p /> This is how I do it in my config.ru <p /> <script src="https://gist.github.com/319783.js"></script><p /> MockClient is the Sinatra app. <p /> You can do anything in the configure block that you would normally do <br />in the configure block in your Sinatra app. Nice eh?
