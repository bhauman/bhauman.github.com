title: Spotlight can't find Applications
published: true

So spotlight decided that it didn't know where any of my Applications <br />were. This really puts a damper in my work flow so here is the <br />solution. <p /> In Snow Leopard open Terminal and type: <p /> [code] 
arch -i386 mdimport /Applications 
[/code] <p /> If you aren't using Snow Leopard just skip the 'arch -i386' and it should work. <p /> This will reindex your Applications directory which will enable <br />Spotlight to find your Applications again.
