You might think you just obliterated the project you were working on <br />with a careless rm -rf * But don't go off and start looking for good <br />noose making materials. Your .git directory is probably still there so <br />you can definitely fix things real quick. <p /> You can at least get things back to where they were by saving your <br />open editor buffers and checking out files from the last commit. <p /> Thank all that is good for this sane default. <p /> I will never put off setting up a github repository for a project <br />again ... I will not ... I really hope I don't
