<div><b>Fast Tests</b></div><p /><div>Having a fast test suite is the best gift we can give ourselves and get out of the depressing time suck of Rails loading for each test run.</div><p /><div>Fast tests by Corey Haines.</div> <div><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bNn6M2vqxHE?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></div><p /><div><b>OOP on Rails</b></div><p /><div>There has been some very good thinking going on lately about what to do to make rails apps more maintainable. This movement has been coming along and the recommendations result in fast test suites and decoupled code. What if you could back out of a feature easily rather than having it's various elements spread throughout your codebase?</div> <p /><div>Uncle Bob Martins great talk:</div><div><a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years">http://www.confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years</a><p /> </div><div>This is a terrific (free) book by the author of Exceptional Ruby Advi Grimm:</div><a href="http://objectsonrails.com/">http://objectsonrails.com/</a><p /><div><b>CSS</b></div><p /><div><div> There is some good work being done in the CSS world as well. Object oriented CSS for one thing.The idea is that you trade off having more classes on your objects for more maintainable pluggable blocks of display code. Twitter Bootstrap is an example of this methodology. </div> <p /><div>The payoff of this method is having organized understandable CSS code. The short message is to stop stop the context based CSS madness.</div><p /><div><a href="http://bem.github.com/bem-method/pages/beginning/beginning.en.html">http://bem.github.com/bem-method/pages/beginning/beginning.en.html</a></div> </div>
