<p>I have used Ido for a while with out reading the docs. There often <br />comes a time when I want to create a file with a name that matches <br />another file in the current directory. <p /> The magic command is Ctrl-j <p /> That will make a new file from the name you have just typed. <p /> Now I am off to read the rest of the docs. <p /> <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings#toc2">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings#toc2</a></p>
