title: A warning about lingering Rails 2.3 ActiveRecord::Observers
published: true
---
<p>I just had a Rails 2.3&nbsp;ActiveRecord::Observer&nbsp;that wasn't configured to be used "spontaneously" get pulled into my running app and get activated. &nbsp;</p>
<p />
<div>This observer was old and should have been deleted from the source code. &nbsp;But I kept it around. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Anyway, it got pulled into the namespace after my app had been running for a week and crashed a lot of functionality.</div>
<p />
<div>So get rid of ActiveRecord::Observers that are not being used!!!!</div>
