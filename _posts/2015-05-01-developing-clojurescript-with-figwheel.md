I recently had a lot of fun giving a talk about [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) in Portland, at
ClojureWest 2015. Figwheel facilitates an almost effortless live
development workflow when you are working with ClojureScript.

In the talk, I explained why I created Figwheel and I demonstrated
its current feature set live.

Below, I have embedded videos that start at the different sections of the talk.

Take advantage of the fact that all the ClojureWest Sessions are [now currently online](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaLlzGqiPE2QRj6sSOawJRg).

ClojureWest was an absolutely amazing experience. I enjoyed meeting some absolutely great folks and I am really looking forward to next year.
