title: "Emacs: Interactively Find and Replace String Patterns on Multiple Files"

This is such an invaluable tutorial! I posted it before on twitter but here it is again:
<ul> 
<li>Call "dired" or "find-dired" to list files in dir and all subdirs.</li>
<li>Mark the files you want. You can mark by regex by typing "%m"</li>
<li>Type "Q" to call dired-do-query-replace-regexp.</li> 
<li>Type your find regex and replace string.</li> 
<li>For each occurance, type "y" to replace, "n" to skip, "!" for replacing all occurances in current file. Type "<span class="kbd"><span class="key">Ctrl</span>+<span class="key">g</span></span>"
 to abort the whole operation.</li> 
<li>To do the replacement on all files without further asking, type "Y". To skip all possible replacement on the rest of the current file, type "N". (These are Emacs 23 only)</li>
<li>Call "ibuffer" to list all opened files.</li>
<li>Type "*u" to mark all unsaved files, type "S" to save all marked files, type "D" to close them all.</li>
</ul>
