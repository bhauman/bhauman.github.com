In our race to slow down the coronavirus, we are deploying
**mitigation** strategies. Strategies that will slow down the rate of
infection, not necessarily the total number of infections. This is
intended to buy us time and allow us to prepare our medical systems to
handle this emergency.

[**Suppression**](suppression) of the virus is a more pro-active
stance where we test absolutely everyone and actively move to reduce
the number of new infections as they did in China which just yesterday
reported [0 new cases](0 cases). It's important to note, we can trust
that number is pretty accurate because of how China has actively
increased testing data-flow to create a very complete picture of how
the virus is progressing.

What can the software industry do to help us suppress COVID-19?
**Create software to actively track virus relevant data about members
of a community, town, business, and/or country.** Having this
data would allow us to be more surgical with our social distancing
orders.

A rudimentary version of this software could be deployed right now in
a community to increase confidence that it's OK to go to the store and
perhaps eat at the cafe.

The rudimentary software could take the form of requiring everyone in
the community to self report their body temperature every morning and
evening. This simple data-stream alone would provide extremely
important actionable information. How to act on that information would
need to depend on crunching the numbers to learn the cost benefit of
any given public activity. Communities and governments can then create
guidelines or emergency orders based on a much more sophisticated view
of the situation.

Simple temperature tracking software like this can possibly give
communities a bit more room to keep functioning while staying
vigilant.

There is absolutely no reason to keep it this software simple, we live
in a world of technological and data abundance. We can combine body
temperature, location, medical test results and social graph
data-streams into a powerful weapon against COVID-19.

In an ideal situation, as soon as someone shows symptoms, we can
respond instantly and raise an alert on the phone of everyone they may
have been close to with over the last 24 hours to let them know that
they have may been exposed and that they need to stay home and self-monitor
or head to the nearest testing facility.

There are compliance issues, where people will report a bogus
temperatures, but there are always compliance issues and we will have
to bake this into our risk calculations.

These data-streams would be extremely invasive but the benefit
outweighs the cost by a large margin. These tracking measures would
have to be dropped at the end of a pandemic when a vaccine has been
distributed.

The possibilities for applications that consume this information are
endless:

* A simple app on your phone could display your status as green yellow
or red, allowing vendors to make informed decisions
* A viral weather application to let you know the risk today in your location
* complex data analysis that draws borders around communities and the
  rate of movement between communities into consideration
* gives you are a rating for the risk in the store you are about to enter
* emergency order that everyone in any bar, restaurant, gym setting
  have a certain level of compliance
* Apple watch like devices are a perfect fit for this, but we could
  manufacture small inexpensive wrist band devices that track body
  temperature and location

Big tech (Facebook, Google, Twitter, Apple) can easily create
solutions in this space in a very short timeline. (They can and should
share data on an established protocol.)

There is a potential downside of folks getting this data coming to the
wrong conclusions. It is apparently very easy even for our leaders to
see low numbers and come to the wrong risk assesment. Any guidelines
that come out of the increased data-flow created by **suppression
software** should be modeled and carefully deployed. This is no place
for guesswork.

I think it's essential to move toward an information rich decision
making environment that might allow society to function well even in
midst of such a tremendous global challenge.
