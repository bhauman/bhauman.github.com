title: Setting width and height of Paperclip image upload on create
published: false
listing_hide: true

<p>I am really liking <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a>. &nbsp;I like the fact that they have the ImageMagick shell commands baked right in. &nbsp;I also like the fact that they have processors that you can use to process an image further.</p>
<p />
<div>But it doesn't save the height and width to the model by default and I couldn't find smart code to do it so here is what I did:<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;<script src="https://gist.github.com/303767.js"></script><p /> <br /></div>
